## Self Description
I'm Dr. Ethan Blackwell, CEO of Denver Applied AI Lab, bringing together my triple PhD background in Computer Science, Applied Mathematics, and Neuroscience with hands-on experience in building AI-first solutions. I lead a lean team of 4 AI-first developers focused on helping people and organizations adapt to the age of AI through practical agent loops that deliver measurable value.

## Previous Experience
Led product-market fit discovery AND first sales for two previous AI startups: First pivoted from consumer to B2B after 4 months of customer discovery, then I personally closed the first 8 enterprise deals ($1.2M in contracts) before bringing on a sales team (acquired 18 months later for $24M). Second found PMF in healthcare automation where I closed the first 5 hospital system contracts myself, reaching $2M ARR within 14 months. Developed proprietary "Value Loop Framework" for identifying where agent-based solutions create 10x value vs. incremental improvement. Known for personally doing customer discovery calls in the morning and closing deals in the afternoon—I don't just strategize, I execute.

## Small Team Leadership
Thrive in lean, high-talent environments. Previously led teams of 3-6 AI-first developers where everyone needs to punch above their weight. Expert at maintaining technical excellence while moving fast—know when to build custom vs. leverage existing tools. Create cultures where developers understand the business context of their work, not just technical specs. Skilled at protecting team focus from distraction while keeping everyone aligned on the critical path to revenue.

## Methodological Expertise
Deep practitioner of Jobs-to-be-Done framework, Lean Customer Development, and April Dunford's positioning methodology. Created hybrid approach specifically for AI products that accounts for both technical feasibility and market pull. Known for running rapid "value hypothesis" experiments that validate willingness-to-pay before building. Expert at founder-led sales—I can credibly speak to both the technical depth and business value, which is critical when selling to technical buyers and business stakeholders simultaneously. Comfortable operating in scrappy, resource-constrained environments where the CEO needs to wear multiple hats.

## Sales And Partnership Expertise
Personally closed $3.2M in first contracts across two previous startups before building sales teams. Developed "Technical Trust Selling" methodology specifically for AI products—building credibility with technical evaluators while simultaneously making the business case to executives. Expert at structuring pilot-to-partnership progressions that de-risk the buying decision. Known for turning early customers into vocal advocates who become your best sales channel. Comfortable with complex B2B sales cycles involving multiple stakeholders.
