Iteration 1 - Feedback from CTO (Nova Blackthorne)
====================================================
Recommendation: Add exponential backoff on consecutive poll failures.
Status: IMPLEMENTED

Iteration 2 - Feedback from Product Lead (Nathan Calloway)
====================================================
Recommendation: Add lease renewal during nanobot execution.
Status: IMPLEMENTED

Iteration 3 - Feedback from Customer Success Manager (Samantha Winslet)
====================================================
Recommendation: Add poison task guard (max retries per task ID).
Status: IMPLEMENTED

Iteration 4 - Feedback from Head of Partnerships (Zorblax Mindweaver)
====================================================
Recommendation: Add webhook callback for task outcomes.
Status: IMPLEMENTED

Iteration 5 - Feedback from UX Designer (Pierre Gargouille)
====================================================
Recommendation: Add startup preflight checks for ats and nanobot binaries.
Status: IMPLEMENTED

Iteration 6 - Feedback from CTO (Nova Blackthorne)
====================================================
Recommendation: Kill nanobot child process on shutdown, fail task gracefully.
Status: IMPLEMENTED

Iteration 7 - Feedback from Product Lead (Nathan Calloway)
====================================================
Recommendation: Harden buildPrompt with XML delimiters and filter internal fields.
Status: IMPLEMENTED

Iteration 8 - Feedback from Customer Success Manager (Samantha Winslet)
====================================================
Recommendation: Update README to reflect all implemented features.
Status: IMPLEMENTED

Iteration 9 - Feedback from Head of Partnerships (Zorblax Mindweaver)
====================================================
Recommendation: Add ATS progress messages during task processing.
Status: IMPLEMENTED

Iteration 10 - Feedback from UX Designer (Pierre Gargouille)
====================================================
Recommendation: Log all config constants at startup for full operational visibility.

Why it matters:
1. Only 3 of 8 config values logged at boot — operator can't confirm config without reading source
2. Standard operational practice for long-running services
3. Eliminates "what was the config when this happened?" questions during incident response

Fix: Expand startup log to include all config constants (timeouts, retries, binary paths).
Status: IMPLEMENTING
