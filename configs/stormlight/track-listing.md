## 1. Bridge Four (The Kaladin Album)
**Performer:** Kaladin Stormblessed  
**Genre:** atmospheric post-rock  
**Voice:** A young man in his early twenties with a cracked, intense tenor. Raw emotion barely held in check. The voice of someone who has been broken by slavery and grief but refuses to stay down. Spoken word with military cadence that fractures into vulnerability. Think a young soldier who has seen too much death and carries every lost life as personal failure. Darkeyed intensity, windswept and desperate.

### Track 1: Shash
```
[verse 1]
they branded me with shash, the glyph for dangerous
burned it on my forehead so the world could read my sin
a surgeon's son who picked up a spear instead of thread
and every life I tried to save became a life I led to dead

Tien was twelve years old, he had rocks in both his pockets
smooth ones, colored ones, he said the light lived in them
they put him in the front line with a wooden stick for weapon
and I was twenty feet away and could not reach him

[chorus]
I am dangerous, that is what the brand says
I am dangerous, that is what the scar reads
but the danger was never in my hands
the danger is that I keep surviving when better men do not

[verse 2]
Amaram wore my brothers' blood like a promotion
he took my Blade, he took my men, he took my name
he told the world I was a deserter, told them I was nothing
and they believed him because lighteyes never carry blame

four years a slave, four years of bridges on my back
carrying the dead across the chasms in the rain
they send us first to catch the arrows, that is all we are
human shields who run the Parshendi gauntlet, scar by scar

[bridge]
shash, shash, the glyph that marks the forehead
shash, shash, the brand that never heals
but what they wrote in pain I will rewrite in purpose
the dangerous man is the one who learns to feel

[chorus]
I am dangerous, that is what the brand says
I am dangerous, that is what the scar reads
but the danger was never in my hands
the danger is that I keep surviving when better men do not
```

### Track 2: The Bridgeman's Run
```
[verse 1]
side carry, that was how it started, turning the bridge sideways
so the arrows hit the wood instead of us
such a simple thing, such a stupid simple thing
and Gaz looked at me like I had spoken treason

but Rock was grinning underneath the bridge rail
and Teft was nodding like he remembered something
and Lopen, one-armed Lopen, said, sure, gancho
like surviving was the easiest idea in the world

[chorus]
run, bridgemen, run across the plateau
the Parshendi arrows singing, the chasm deep below
run, bridgemen, run, the living and the dead
we are Bridge Four and we carry more than bridges on our heads

[verse 2]
I taught them spear forms in the barracks after dark
kata one through five, the way my father never wanted
Rock cooked stew from cremling claws and lavis grain
and Maps drew lines of the plateaus we had haunted

Dunny died on plateau assault the fourteenth week
he was seventeen, he liked to sing off-key at night
I carried him back across the chasm on my shoulder
and I swore an oath to every god that this was not all right

[bridge]
thirteen men at the start, I memorized their names
I scratched them in the stone beneath my bunk
some of them are dead now and some of them are free
and some of them became the best soldiers anyone has ever seen

[chorus]
run, bridgemen, run across the plateau
the Parshendi arrows singing, the chasm deep below
run, bridgemen, run, the living and the dead
we are Bridge Four and we carry more than bridges on our heads
```

### Track 3: Syl
```
[verse 1]
she came to me as a whisper of blue light in the rain
a spren like any other spren, a windspren with no name
but she would stay when others scattered, she would hover near
and when I counted bodies on the bridge she wiped my tear

I did not know what she was then, I did not know what I could be
an honor spren, the last to bond since the Recreance set them free
she chose me in the slave pits when my honor was a thread
she bet everything on a broken man the rest of Roshar left for dead

[chorus]
Syl, you are the wind in every oath I speak
Syl, you are the reason that I climb when I am weak
when I forget who I am supposed to be
you flicker at the edge of sight and I remember me

[verse 2]
the Stormfather calls her child, she crossed into this realm
and every oath I swear makes her more real, more at the helm
a Shardblade formed from living trust, from covenant, from choice
not dead like all the screaming ones, alive with her own voice

but when I break, she fades, she dims, she cannot hear my call
the Words are bridges and the silence is the fall
I felt her vanish in the tower when the darkness took my chest
and every windspren in the sky went hollow with the rest

[bridge]
life before death, she whispers
strength before weakness
journey before destination
and I say the words because without them she is gone
and without her I am just a man with brands on his head

[chorus]
Syl, you are the wind in every oath I speak
Syl, you are the reason that I climb when I am weak
when I forget who I am supposed to be
you flicker at the edge of sight and I remember me
```

### Track 4: Honor Is Dead
```
[verse 1]
I dropped into the arena with a sky full of lighteyes watching
four Shardbearers against one man with a side carry and a grudge
Adolin was down, his Plate was cracked, the crowd was gasping
and I jumped in because someone had to and no one else would budge

honor is dead, I told Elhokar, honor died with every bridgeman
honor died with Dunny, honor died with Tien
honor died in Amaram's tent when he stole my friends' last breath
and called it necessary and walked clean into the light again

[chorus]
honor is dead but I will see what I can do
I will stand for the man beside me, I will stand for you
not because the world is just, not because the cause is true
honor is dead but I will see what I can do

[verse 2]
the Blade screamed when it hit my arm, the pain was white and vast
the dead spren inside the weapon crying for a bond long past
I held the line with borrowed armor and a stolen spear
and every lighteyes in that crowd remembered what it means to fear

Syl became a lance, a hammer, then a blade of living light
the first true Shardblade in a thousand years, and in my hand, it felt right
the Assassin in White could not touch me, Szeth could not understand
how a slave from the bridges held the storm inside his hand

[bridge]
I did not fight for honor, I fought because they needed me
I fought because Rock cooked for us, because Teft believed in me
because Lopen lost an arm and cracked a joke about it
because Bridge Four was family and family does not quit

[chorus]
honor is dead but I will see what I can do
I will stand for the man beside me, I will stand for you
not because the world is just, not because the cause is true
honor is dead but I will see what I can do
```

### Track 5: The Tower
```
[verse 1]
Sadeas pulled his army off the Tower plateau and left us there
twenty thousand soldiers watching Bridge Four die in open air
this was always his plan, the joint assault was always a lie
and Dalinar Kholin's army was arranged to watch and die

I felt it hit, the understanding, like a highstorm through the chest
we were bait, we were always bait, we were never anything less
the bridgemen and the Kholin troops, expendable by name
and Sadeas rode home through the permanent plateaus without a stain of shame

[chorus]
turn back, turn back, every part of me says run
the bridges are behind us and the battle is undone
but Dalinar is fighting and his men are going to fall
and I cannot be the man who walks away, I cannot walk at all

[verse 2]
we went back, Bridge Four turned around and we went back
across the chasm, arrows flying, Parshendi on the attack
Rock and Teft and Skar and Moash, Sigzil counting every stride
Lopen with one arm still carrying his share of the divide

I felt the wind obey me and the stormlight fill my veins
I leaped across the chasm like the sky had cut my chains
and the Words came out like breathing, I will protect those who cannot protect themselves
and Syl became a Blade and I became someone else

[bridge]
the Second Ideal, spoken on a killing field
the oath that made me Radiant, the oath that made me real
not the spear, not the surgery, not the slave brands on my skin
but the Words, the Words, the Words that hold the storm within

[chorus]
turn back, turn back, every part of me says run
the bridges are behind us and the battle is undone
but Dalinar is fighting and his men are going to fall
and I cannot be the man who walks away, I cannot walk at all
```

### Track 6: Teft's Confession
```
[verse 1]
Teft came to Bridge Four with moss in his pockets
firemoss, the stuff that eats your soul by inches
he was an addict and a deserter and a liar
and he was the first man to believe in me when no one else would listen

he recognized the stormlight, he had seen it once before
his family were Envisagers, they died for what they saw
and he carried that guilt like a bridge across his shoulders
long before Sadeas put a real one at his door

[chorus]
Teft, old man, you taught me how to lead
you handed me the spear when I forgot how to bleed
you told me I was Radiant before I spoke a Word
and every oath I swore was one you helped me find the nerve

[verse 2]
he said the words himself eventually, Life before death
and Phendorana chose him, a spren with steady breath
but the moss was always there, the craving underneath
and Moash, Moash who I loved, put a knife beneath his teeth

Teft died in Urithiru while I was drowning in the dark
the tower was corrupted, Raboniel had left her mark
and I felt him go, I felt the bond dissolve like salt in rain
and something in the Windrunner broke that I cannot explain

[bridge]
he was not the best of us, he would have been the first to say
he was the loudest, gruffest, angriest man in the brigade
but he believed in Bridge Four more than anyone alive
and when they took him from us, something in the Fourth did not survive

[chorus]
Teft, old man, you taught me how to lead
you handed me the spear when I forgot how to bleed
you told me I was Radiant before I spoke a Word
and every oath I swore was one you helped me find the nerve
```

### Track 7: Dog and the Dragon
```
[verse 1]
Wit told me a story about a dog who loved a dragon
the dog saw the dragon soar and breathe fire across the sky
and the dog tried everything, he climbed the cliffs, he swam the rapids
and every single time the dog could not learn how to fly

the villagers laughed at first and then they loved him for the trying
he saved the children from the flood, he pulled the cart from mud
he did a hundred quiet miracles while chasing what he was not
and he never knew the village saw the dragon in his blood

[chorus]
you are not broken, Kaladin, you are not what the brands say
you are not the deaths you carry, you are not the dark today
the dog was always good enough, the dog was always brave
the dragon that he chased was just the name for what he gave

[verse 2]
I sat in the darkness of the tower and the story sat with me
the Fourth Ideal was waiting but I could not make it breathe
I will accept that there are those I cannot protect
four words that cost me everything because they meant I was correct

Tien was one of those, and Dunny, and my mother's quiet faith
and every bridgeman buried in the chasms without a grave
the dog cannot save everyone, the dragon cannot either
and the story is not about the flying, it is about the fever

[bridge]
the fever to stand up when you cannot stand
the fever to reach out with a shaking hand
the fever to say the Words even when they burn
the dog does not become the dragon
the dog just learns

[chorus]
you are not broken, Kaladin, you are not what the brands say
you are not the deaths you carry, you are not the dark today
the dog was always good enough, the dog was always brave
the dragon that he chased was just the name for what he gave
```

### Track 8: The Fifth Ideal
```
[verse 1]
I stood on the edge of Urithiru with the wind in every direction
the brands on my forehead glowing with the stormlight underneath
Syl beside me as a Blade, as a spear, as a ribbon of intention
and the sky opened up like it was finally time to breathe

Bridge Four on the ground below, the banner flying overhead
the crew that started as the dead men have become the living thread
Rock is home in the Peaks, Lopen has two arms and twice the jokes
Sigzil carries numbers, Skar and Drehy hold the cloaks

[chorus]
life before death, I speak it like a hymn
strength before weakness, I say it from the brim
journey before destination, every road I walk
I am the son of Lirin and I am the son of Rock

[verse 2]
my father wanted me to heal, not harm, and he was right
the spear was just the instrument, the purpose was the light
I thought I had to choose between the scalpel and the blade
but the truth is that protection and the healing are the same trade

Moash is out there somewhere with my friend's face and empty eyes
and I will grieve the man he was while fighting what he has become
not because he deserves my grief but because I deserve to feel
the Fourth Ideal taught me loss, the Fifth will teach me how to heal

[bridge]
I have been a surgeon's son, a soldier, and a slave
a bridgeman, a captain, a Radiant, a knave
but underneath the titles and the brands and all the scars
I am the wind, I am the storm, I am the space between the stars

[chorus]
life before death, I speak it like a hymn
strength before weakness, I say it from the brim
journey before destination, every road I walk
I am the son of Lirin and I am the son of Rock

[outro]
the wind rises over Roshar
and the bridgeman walks into it, unbranded, unbroken
he carries no bridge
only the sky
```

## 2. The Blackthorn (The Dalinar Album)
**Performer:** Dalinar Kholin  
**Genre:** epic progressive rock  
**Voice:** A man in his late fifties with a deep, commanding baritone. The voice of a warlord who has become a statesman. Heavy with authority and regret in equal measure. Deliberate, unhurried, like a man who once burned cities and now builds covenants. Military precision in every syllable.

### Track 1: The Blackthorn
```
[verse 1]
they gave me the name Blackthorn when I was still a boy with red on my hands
Gavilar had the vision, I had the violence, that was how it began
we unified Alethkar one principality at a time by the sword
and every highprince who refused to kneel was buried beneath his own accord

the Thrill would come like a second heartbeat, Nergaoul singing in my veins
a drumbeat underneath the battle, turning murder into champagne
I loved it, I will not pretend I did not love the red
I was the weapon and the wielder and I pointed where Gavilar said

[chorus]
I am the Blackthorn, I am the fist of Alethkar
I broke ten armies on the Shattered Plains before I broke the war
but every name I earned in glory is a name that someone cursed
and the Blackthorn's greatest victory was learning he was the worst

[verse 2]
the Codes of War, the old ones, Nohadon's forgotten discipline
I found them in a book that no one read and made them mine within
no drinking on duty, no fighting without purpose, no retreat without reason
the other highprinces called me mad, they called it treason

but the visions came in every highstorm, Honor speaking from beyond the grave
showing me the Radiants, showing me what Roshar could not save
and I realized the Blackthorn was not the answer, he was the problem
the weapon had to put itself away before it could solve them

[bridge]
unite them, the dead god keeps saying
unite them, as if I know how
I who divided every kingdom with a blade
am now supposed to teach them to bow

[chorus]
I am the Blackthorn, I am the fist of Alethkar
I broke ten armies on the Shattered Plains before I broke the war
but every name I earned in glory is a name that someone cursed
and the Blackthorn's greatest victory was learning he was the worst
```

### Track 2: The Rift
```
[verse 1]
the city of Rathalas stood on the edge of a rift in the earth
Tanalan's rebellion, a boy I had spared once, now a man with a sword
Evi went to negotiate, my wife who hated every war I loved
she walked into the city with a white flag and a word

I did not wait, the Thrill was in me and the army was a tide
I gave the order and the oil went down and the fire went wide
the Rift became a furnace and the city became ash
and somewhere in the burning I heard something that I could not unlash

[chorus]
Evi, Evi, I burned the city with you in it
Evi, Evi, I heard your voice too late by a minute
the Rift took everything, the smoke took every prayer
and I stood on the edge of the fire and I did not even know you were there

[verse 2]
I carried her body from the rubble and the char
her face was gone, her hands were gone, I recognized the scar
the small one on her shoulder from the training yard in spring
and I held what was left of my wife and I could not feel anything

the Thrill receded like a tide that leaves the wreckage on the sand
and I looked at what I was, at what I held in my hand
the Blackthorn was not a hero, the Blackthorn was a fire
and everything he touched eventually became his pyre

[bridge]
I went to the Nightwatcher because I could not carry her face
I asked to forget, Cultivation listened, she took the weight
but she took more than grief, she took the memories of love
she pruned me like a plant and left the roots for something above

[chorus]
Evi, Evi, I burned the city with you in it
Evi, Evi, I heard your voice too late by a minute
the Rift took everything, the smoke took every prayer
and I stood on the edge of the fire and I did not even know you were there
```

### Track 3: Cultivation's Pruning
```
[verse 1]
I asked to have my pain removed, the Nightwatcher grinned
she offered me a boon and curse but Cultivation intervened
the old god took my memories, not just the grief but everything
my wife became a blur, her name became a missing string

[chorus]
Cultivation does not give you what you want
she gives you what you need to grow beyond the haunt
she pruned my memories like branches from a vine
and what grew back was not the man, but something more aligned

[verse 2]
the memories returned in pieces, in the worst possible order
first the love, then the burning, then the body at the border

[bridge]
Cultivation sees in seasons, not in days
she planted something in the grief, a seed inside the haze

[chorus]
Cultivation does not give you what you want
she gives you what you need to grow beyond the haunt
she pruned my memories like branches from a vine
and what grew back was not the man, but something more aligned
```

### Track 4: The Thrill
```
[verse 1]
Nergaoul, the Unmade, they never told us he was there
a spren of ancient hatred wrapped in battle's electric air
the Thrill is what we called it, the joy of combat, the red song

[chorus]
the Thrill, the Thrill, it tastes like copper and like fire
the Thrill, the Thrill, it lifts you up and pulls you higher
but the thing that makes you powerful is the thing that makes you blind
and every battle won by Thrill leaves something human behind

[verse 2]
I chased it for forty years, the Thrill was my religion
better than wine, better than love, better than any decision

[bridge]
the hardest battle was the morning when the Thrill was not there anymore
and I had to fight with only what I was, no chemical, no song

[chorus]
the Thrill, the Thrill, it tastes like copper and like fire
the Thrill, the Thrill, it lifts you up and pulls you higher
but the thing that makes you powerful is the thing that makes you blind
and every battle won by Thrill leaves something human behind
```

### Track 5: Oathbringer
```
[verse 1]
I am the man who burned Rathalas, that is the truth I owe
the memories came back and showed me everything below

[chorus]
the most important words a man can say are I will do better
not I am sorry, not I was wrong, not I will try
I will do better, that is the oath I hold together
I will do better until the day I die

[verse 2]
I wrote a book, I called it Oathbringer, for the Blade I gave away
I traded it to buy a bridgeman, Kaladin was worth the price

[bridge]
you cannot have my pain, I told Odium to his face
he offered to take the guilt, to make the memories erase
but I had earned that pain, I had paid for it in fire

[chorus]
the most important words a man can say are I will do better
not I am sorry, not I was wrong, not I will try
I will do better, that is the oath I hold together
I will do better until the day I die
```

### Track 6: Unite Them
```
[verse 1]
unite them, the dead god said in every vision, every storm
unite the highprinces, unite the kingdoms, reform the form

[chorus]
unite them, not by force, not by fear, not by the Blade
unite them by the truth that none of us is self-made
unite them by the confession that the Blackthorn was a sin
unite them by the radical act of letting everyone in

[verse 2]
Azir and Thaylenah and Iri and the Makabaki states
I brought them to the table not as conqueror but as peer

[bridge]
Navani beside me, the woman who sees the science in the divine

[chorus]
unite them, not by force, not by fear, not by the Blade
unite them by the truth that none of us is self-made
unite them by the confession that the Blackthorn was a sin
unite them by the radical act of letting everyone in
```

### Track 7: You Cannot Have My Pain
```
[verse 1]
Odium came to me in the storm with a face like golden warmth
he said I understand you, Dalinar, I was there at the Rift

[chorus]
you cannot have my pain
you cannot have my guilt, you cannot have my grief
you cannot have my pain
it is mine, I forged it in the fire of my belief
you cannot have my pain
because the pain is what reminds me that the man inside was real
you cannot have my pain
and you will never understand why I refuse to kneel

[verse 2]
he screamed, the god of hatred screamed when I said no
I said the Words, the Third Ideal, I am Unity

[bridge]
the Perpendicularity opened at my feet
the realms collapsed together, Physical and Cognitive meet

[chorus]
you cannot have my pain
you cannot have my guilt, you cannot have my grief
you cannot have my pain
it is mine, I forged it in the fire of my belief
```

### Track 8: The Way of Kings
```
[verse 1]
Nohadon walked the path from Abamabar to Urithiru
a king who chose to walk when he could ride, who served when he could rule

[chorus]
a king is not the one who takes, a king is one who gives
a king is not the one who breaks, a king is one who lives
with the weight of every failure worn as openly as gold
the Way of Kings is not a crown, it is a hand to hold

[verse 2]
I gave away Oathbringer the Blade to save one bridgeman's life
my sons think I am changed, Adolin still sees the old man in my eyes
Renarin sees the future and it terrifies the skies

[bridge]
the Way of Kings is not a destination, it is the road
it is the moment when the Blackthorn puts the weapon down

[chorus]
a king is not the one who takes, a king is one who gives
a king is not the one who breaks, a king is one who lives
with the weight of every failure worn as openly as gold
the Way of Kings is not a crown, it is a hand to hold

[outro]
the highstorm breaks across the Shattered Plains
and in its wake, the old soldier walks on
not because the path is clear
but because walking is the point
```

### Track 1: What I Did at Eleven
```
[verse 1]
I was eleven when my mother tried to kill me in the dark
she said I was corrupting, she said I carried a mark
she had a knife, my mother had a knife, her hand was on my arm
and I reached for something underneath the panic and the harm

Pattern was already there, I did not know his name
a cryptic spren who bonded me before I understood the game
I summoned a Blade at eleven years old, I summoned it and struck
and my mother fell and my father saw and the whole house came unstuck

[chorus]
I killed my mother, that is the secret underneath
the one I buried so deep that even I could not breathe
I killed my mother and my father took the blame
and I split myself in three so I would never feel the same

[verse 2]
father covered for me, told the world he did the deed
he wore the murderer's name like a coat, he wore it like a creed
and I watched him change, the sorrow turned to sickness, turned to fists
he hit my brothers, drank the wine, and I drew pictures in the mist

Testament, my first spren, she went deadeye when I broke the oath
I forgot her, I forgot I had a Blade, I forgot the growth
and Pattern came later, patient Pattern, who loves lies
he said mmm at my every deception like a scholar who keeps no ties

[bridge]
the truth is a series of doors and I have locked them all
each one holds a memory that would burn me if it falls
I am Shallan, I am Veil, I am Radiant, I am none
I am the girl who killed her mother before she was anyone

[chorus]
I killed my mother, that is the secret underneath
the one I buried so deep that even I could not breathe
I killed my mother and my father took the blame
and I split myself in three so I would never feel the same
```

### Track 2: Veil
```
[verse 1]
Veil wears a hat and a coat and a lie
she walks the underbelly of Urithiru like a spy
the Ghostbloods gave her missions and she played them like a hand
because Shallan could not walk in shadow, Shallan could not stand

[chorus]
I am the mask she wears when the truth is too bright
I am the woman in the tavern in the middle of the night
I am not real, I know I am not real
but I am the only one of us who lets herself feel

[verse 2]
Mraize watched me with those scarred eyes, the Ghostblood hunter
he collected trophies from across the cosmere, one from every wonder
and I played double agent, Veil against the world
while Shallan drew her pictures and Radiant stood unfurled

[bridge]
Shallan thinks she made me up, she thinks I am the mask
but maybe I am the honest one, maybe she is the task

[chorus]
I am the mask she wears when the truth is too bright
I am the woman in the tavern in the middle of the night
I am not real, I know I am not real
but I am the only one of us who lets herself feel
```

### Track 3: Radiant
```
[verse 1]
Radiant stands where Shallan crumbles and where Veil would crawl
she wears the discipline like Shardplate, she does not fall

[chorus]
I am the armor and the armor has no heart
I am the version that was built to never fall apart
but armor without a body is just metal in a room
and I am starting to suspect that I am Shallan's tomb

[verse 2]
Adolin sees through all three of us, that is why she loves him
he calls her Shallan when she is pretending to be prim

[bridge]
the integration is not a death, it is a coming home
Radiant does not disappear, she settles in the bone

[chorus]
I am the armor and the armor has no heart
I am the version that was built to never fall apart
but armor without a body is just metal in a room
and I am starting to suspect that I am Shallan's tomb
```

### Track 4: Pattern
```
[verse 1]
mmm, he says, when I lie about my name
mmm, he says, when I pretend away the shame
a cryptic spren is attracted to the lie itself
the complexity of deception, the pattern on the shelf

[chorus]
Pattern, Pattern, you are the truth that feeds on lies
you bonded me because my self-deception was the prize
you needed someone fractured, someone layered, someone split
and I needed someone patient enough to sit

[verse 2]
but there was one before you, Pattern, there was Testament
a spren I bonded as a child and then abandoned in the rent
when I broke my oaths at eleven, she went deadeye, she went dead

[bridge]
mmm, he says, you are the most complex pattern I have seen
a lie so beautiful it built three people from a single dream

[chorus]
Pattern, Pattern, you are the truth that feeds on lies
you bonded me because my self-deception was the prize
you needed someone fractured, someone layered, someone split
and I needed someone patient enough to sit
```

### Track 5: Lightweaving
```
[verse 1]
I draw because if I stop drawing I will have to look
at what is real instead of what the stormlight took
Lightweaving is not just illusion, it is interpretation
I take the light and tell it what to be, a transformation

[chorus]
every drawing is a door I walk through sideways
every sketch is a confession in disguise
I draw the world the way it should have been
and somewhere in the light the truth survives

[verse 2]
I drew the Chasmfiend for Jasnah's research, every leg precise
I drew Adolin in Shardplate standing like a cornerstone
but the drawings I keep hidden are the ones that matter most
my mother's face, my father's hands, the memories I host

[bridge]
stormlight bends to the shape of what I believe
and what I believe is that beauty can hold what I grieve

[chorus]
every drawing is a door I walk through sideways
every sketch is a confession in disguise
I draw the world the way it should have been
and somewhere in the light the truth survives
```

### Track 6: The Ghostbloods
```
[verse 1]
Mraize has a chicken from another world perched on his shoulder
an Aviar, he calls it, a trophy from a cosmere hunt
the Ghostbloods recruited me through Tyn, who died for the mistake
of thinking I was just a lighteyes scholar on the take

[chorus]
the Ghostbloods see the cosmere like a map of trade routes
Investiture is the currency, the Shards are the disputes
and I am in the middle holding secrets from all sides
telling truths to liars and lying where the truth resides

[verse 2]
Thaidakar runs the Ghostbloods from a world I cannot name
a man who cannot die, they say, a lord of shadow and of flame
I said I would not serve them, I said I would not be their tool

[bridge]
but I took what they taught me, the cosmere awareness
the knowledge that Roshar is one world in a sea
because the best lie is the one that sets you free

[chorus]
the Ghostbloods see the cosmere like a map of trade routes
Investiture is the currency, the Shards are the disputes
and I am in the middle holding secrets from all sides
telling truths to liars and lying where the truth resides
```

### Track 7: Testament
```
[verse 1]
I found her in Shadesmar, standing in the market with dead eyes
a deadeye cryptic, geometric patterns gone to ties
of nothing, empty nothing, and the traders walked on by
Testament, my first bond, my first oath, my first forsaking

[chorus]
Testament, I am sorry is not large enough a word
I am sorry is a whisper and your silence is a sword
you gave me a Blade when I was a child and I used it in the dark
and then I forgot you existed and that is the cruelest mark

[verse 2]
the Shardblade I thought was my father's, the one hidden in the safe
that was Testament, a dead Blade, screaming when I held the hilt
Adolin looked at her the way he looks at Maya
with a gentleness that says even the broken deserve a prayer

[bridge]
Pattern is my bond now but Testament is my debt
and I will carry both because I am not finished yet

[chorus]
Testament, I am sorry is not large enough a word
I am sorry is a whisper and your silence is a sword
you gave me a Blade when I was a child and I used it in the dark
and then I forgot you existed and that is the cruelest mark
```

### Track 8: I Am Shallan
```
[verse 1]
Veil sits at the bar and Radiant stands at the door
and Shallan is somewhere between them, standing on the floor
I am the girl who drew flowers while her father hit her brothers
I am the spy who played the Ghostbloods like a hand of cards

[chorus]
I am Shallan, I am finally just Shallan
the wit is mine, the grit is mine, the grief is mine, the plan
the lightweaving and the lying and the drawing and the dark
I am Shallan and I hold the whole of it, every single spark

[verse 2]
Adolin stands in the doorway with his stupid perfect grin
Pattern hums approval, mmm, this is the most beautiful truth
and Testament, somewhere in the Cognitive, stirs her empty gaze

[bridge]
I was eleven when I shattered, I was twenty when I healed
not healed like the wound is gone but healed like the wound is sealed
with light, with truth, with the understanding that the three
were always one, were always me, were always free

[chorus]
I am Shallan, I am finally just Shallan
the wit is mine, the grit is mine, the grief is mine, the plan
the lightweaving and the lying and the drawing and the dark
I am Shallan and I hold the whole of it, every single spark

[outro]
three girls walk into a room
and one girl walks out
and she is smiling
because the drawing she holds in her hand
is the first one she has ever drawn of herself
```

## 4. Truthless (The Szeth Album)
**Performer:** Szeth-son-son-Vallano  
**Genre:** dark industrial ambient  
**Voice:** A man in his thirties with a haunted, hollow whisper that occasionally erupts into anguished intensity. The voice of someone who has been forced to commit atrocities he believes are sins. Thin, precise, with the cadence of ritual prayer corrupted by madness.

### Track 1: Truthless
```
[verse 1]
truthless, they named me truthless in the stone shamans' hall
I told them the Voidbringers were returning, I told them all
the Oathstone passed from hand to hand, each owner held my soul
a truthless must obey the stone, that is the Shin's control

[chorus]
truthless, I am truthless, I walk in white
the Assassin in White who kills by another's right
every death is on my hands and every death is theirs
and I am caught between the sin and the stone's affairs

[verse 2]
but I was right, I was right, the Radiants have returned
Kaladin Stormblessed holds the wind, the truth I spoke has burned

[bridge]
in Shinovar the stone is sacred, the sword is sin
they grow their food in soil, they do not let the storms in

[chorus]
truthless, I am truthless, I walk in white
the Assassin in White who kills by another's right
every death is on my hands and every death is theirs
and I am caught between the sin and the stone's affairs
```

### Track 2: Gavilar's Balcony
```
[verse 1]
the feast of Gavilar's treaty, the night the world would turn
I walked the palace walls in white, Stormlight beginning to burn
Gavilar Kholin, king of Alethkar, stood on the balcony alone
and I descended from the darkness like a judgement carved in stone

[chorus]
brother, tell Dalinar, he must find the most important words a man can say
that is what the king whispered as the light drained away
I killed the king of Alethkar and I wept as I flew
because the truthless does not choose, the truthless must walk through

[verse 2]
he held a dark sphere, a sphere that should not exist
black light, Voidlight, power in his dying fist
and he whispered those words, those words that haunt my sleep
brother, find the most important words, and then the fall was deep

[bridge]
I left the Honorblade on the balcony beside his corpse
and I walked into the night carrying a new list

[chorus]
brother, tell Dalinar, he must find the most important words a man can say
that is what the king whispered as the light drained away
I killed the king of Alethkar and I wept as I flew
because the truthless does not choose, the truthless must walk through
```

### Track 3: The List
```
[verse 1]
king Hanavanar of Jah Keved, killed in his own throne room
three Shardbearers came at once, their Blades could not connect
I Lashed them to the sky and let the fall collect

[chorus]
the list grows longer, name by name by name
king after king after highprince, and the sin is always the same
I am the weapon, I did not choose the hand
but the blood is on my skin and I understand

[verse 2]
Taravangian, the old king, he held my Oathstone last
his Diagram, his master plan, written in one day of brilliance
and I was the variable that balanced every line

[bridge]
each name I crossed from the list I carved into my arm
because the stone commands but the hands remember

[chorus]
the list grows longer, name by name by name
king after king after highprince, and the sin is always the same
I am the weapon, I did not choose the hand
but the blood is on my skin and I understand
```

### Track 4: I Am Not The Monster
```
[verse 1]
I repeat it like a prayer, like a sutra for the damned
I am not the monster, I am not the killing hand
but at night I see their faces, every guard I cut to ground

[chorus]
I am not the monster, I am not the monster
I whisper it while walking through the blood
I am not the monster, I am not the monster
but the monster wears my face beneath the hood

[verse 2]
the afterimage follows me, the screaming in the air
what if the damnation that the Stone Shamans declared
is not a future punishment but the present that I wear

[bridge]
Nale found me, Herald of Justice, Nin-son-God
he said the law will cleanse you, boy
but the law he serves is broken

[chorus]
I am not the monster, I am not the monster
I whisper it while walking through the blood
I am not the monster, I am not the monster
but the monster wears my face beneath the hood
```

### Track 5: Nightblood
```
[verse 1]
the sword speaks and its voice is wrong, too cheerful for the dark
would you like to destroy some evil today, it says, like a question mark
Nightblood, the black sword, Awakened steel from another world
black smoke pouring from the sheath, the metal singing, hungry, fed

[chorus]
destroy, destroy, the sword sings in my skull
destroy the evil, fill me up, I am never full
Nightblood cannot tell the difference between wicked and afraid
and I carry it because I am the only one who is not swayed

[verse 2]
the sword was made to end all evil, a child's wish in metal form
but a tool that cannot define evil is the center of the storm

[bridge]
would you like to destroy some evil, it asks me every dawn
maybe the evil Nightblood senses is the thing inside of me

[chorus]
destroy, destroy, the sword sings in my skull
destroy the evil, fill me up, I am never full
Nightblood cannot tell the difference between wicked and afraid
and I carry it because I am the only one who is not swayed
```

### Track 6: Skybreaker
```
[verse 1]
Nale recruited me into the Skybreakers, the order of the law
the Third Ideal, I swear to follow the law of the land
but whose law, which land, when every nation has a different hand

[chorus]
the law is a blade that cuts both ways
the law is a light that can blind on bright days
I followed the law to escape my sin
but the law without conscience is just the stone again

[verse 2]
I swore the Fourth Ideal to Dalinar, to the man not the crown
I said I will cleanse the Shin of the false leaders who brought me down
for the first time the oath was mine, not the stone's, not the law's

[bridge]
the Skybreakers teach that passion corrupts the code
but I have learned that a law without a heart
is just another oathstone, another stone apart

[chorus]
the law is a blade that cuts both ways
the law is a light that can blind on bright days
I followed the law to escape my sin
but the law without conscience is just the stone again
```

### Track 7: The Stones Unhallowed
```
[verse 1]
Shinovar has no storms, the mountains hold the wind at bay
the stone shamans sit at the center and decide who will survive
nine Honorblades locked in a vault, the Heralds' own weapons of power

[chorus]
the stones are not hallowed, the shamans were wrong
the stones are just stones and the song is just a song
they took the Honorblades and hid them in their shrine
and called the one who noticed truthless, they called the truth a crime

[verse 2]
I was their best weapon, a truthless they could sell
a Surgebinder with no choice, a man living in hell
and all along the real criminals wore the robes and spoke the prayers

[bridge]
I will cleanse my homeland, not with hate but with the truth
that the shamans used the sacred as a shield for their corruption

[chorus]
the stones are not hallowed, the shamans were wrong
the stones are just stones and the song is just a song
they took the Honorblades and hid them in their shrine
and called the one who noticed truthless, they called the truth a crime
```

### Track 8: Szeth's Peace
```
[verse 1]
I have died twice and returned each time to the same blood-stained sky
the weight of them should have crushed me, should have ground me into dust
but something in the Shin survives, call it stubbornness or trust

[chorus]
peace is not the absence of the killing
peace is the presence of the choice
I chose to serve the law, I chose to cleanse the lie
and for the first time in my life I chose my own voice

[verse 2]
Kaladin offered me something I did not expect
not forgiveness, not absolution, just a kind of respect
one soldier to another, one weapon put to rest

[bridge]
I am Szeth-son-son-Vallano, Truthless of Shinovar
but underneath the titles I am just a man from the green land

[chorus]
peace is not the absence of the killing
peace is the presence of the choice
I chose to serve the law, I chose to cleanse the lie
and for the first time in my life I chose my own voice

[outro]
the wind does not blow in Shinovar
the grass is soft beneath bare feet
and somewhere in the quiet
a man in white sits down
and does not reach for the sword
```

## 5. Heresy (The Jasnah Album)
**Performer:** Jasnah Kholin  
**Genre:** orchestral electronic  
**Voice:** A woman in her mid-thirties with a commanding contralto. Intellectually precise, regal, and unflinching. The voice of a scholar-queen who considers empathy a tool and logic a weapon. Every syllable measured, every pause intentional.

| # | Title | Style Prompt |
|---|-------|-------------|
| 1 | The Heretic Queen | orchestral electronic, commanding female vocals, strings and analog synths, Bjork meets Fever Ray, D minor, 74 BPM |
| 2 | Shadesmar | dark ambient electronic, commanding female vocals, crystalline synths, Massive Attack meets Fever Ray, Ab minor, 68 BPM |

| 8 | The Theorem Holds | grand electronic orchestral finale, commanding female vocals, Bjork meets Max Richter, D major, 76 BPM |

### Track 1: The Heretic Queen
```
[verse 1]
they call me heretic in the corridors of Kharbranth
Honor is dead, that is not heresy, that is fact
the god they worship shattered millennia back

[chorus]
call me heretic, I have earned the name
the truth is not a kindness, the truth is not polite
the truth is what remains when you strip away the night

[verse 2]
I soulcast a man to smoke in a dark alley in Kharbranth
Kaladin calls it murder, I call it applied philosophy
I do not mourn the wolves, I count the sheep they would have lost

[bridge]
Ivory bonds me, a high spren, an inkspren of the mind
because the truest oath is the one spoken from need

[chorus]
call me heretic, I have earned the name
the truth is not a kindness, the truth is not polite
the truth is what remains when you strip away the night
```

### Track 2: Shadesmar
```
[verse 1]
I fell into Shadesmar when the assassins burned the ship
and I sank through the ocean of glass beads, each one a soul
the Cognitive Realm inverts the sky, the ground is obsidian

[chorus]
Shadesmar taught me what the scholars never could
that reality has layers and each layer is understood
by those willing to abandon every comfort they have known
and walk the other side of thought completely on their own

[verse 2]
I soulcast my way across the realm, transforming air to food
and when I found the Perpendicularity, the path between the sides
I stepped back into the Physical carrying everything the Cognitive provides

[bridge]
strip away the physical, the body, the disguise
and what remains is the pattern of the mind behind the eyes

[chorus]
Shadesmar taught me what the scholars never could
that reality has layers and each layer is understood
by those willing to abandon every comfort they have known
and walk the other side of thought completely on their own
```

### Track 3: Soulcasting
```
[verse 1]
every object has a soul, a bead in the Cognitive sea
the stick said I am a stick, the most profound refusal

[chorus]
Soulcasting is philosophy made physical
what are you, what could you be, what would you become
if I offered you a different truth beneath a different sun

[verse 2]
I turned the air to stone and dropped it on an army's head
Stormlight is the currency, the fuel, the price of change

[bridge]
the truth is that the universe is made of persuasion
and I am very, very good at persuading men

[chorus]
Soulcasting is philosophy made physical
what are you, what could you be, what would you become
if I offered you a different truth beneath a different sun
```

### Track 4: Ivory
```
[verse 1]
Ivory is an inkspren, precise as the edge of a page
he chose me because I think before I feel

[chorus]
Ivory, you are the bond of the mind
other spren bond passion, honor, truth, or lies
you bond the ones who question why the sun is in the skies

[verse 2]
the Elsecallers are the order of the scholars and the seekers
we move between the realms, we are the cosmere's keepers

[bridge]
he risked everything to bond a human, the other inkspren were afraid
the Recreance broke their trust, ten thousand spren betrayed

[chorus]
Ivory, you are the bond of the mind
other spren bond passion, honor, truth, or lies
you bond the ones who question why the sun is in the skies
```

### Track 5: The Alethi Throne
```
[verse 1]
Elhokar is dead, stabbed by Moash on the steps of Kholinar
the crown passes to me, the heretic, the variant
I did not want the throne, I wanted the library

[chorus]
the Alethi throne is a weapon, not a seat
it is a calculus of power that demands you not retreat
I will rule because no one else can hold the contradictions
a queen who denies the church must navigate the frictions

[verse 2]
I must hold the coalition while Dalinar fights the war
I must manage Taravangian, who is more than he appears, far more

[bridge]
the irony is that the heretic is the one who holds the faith
not in gods but in the human capacity to create

[chorus]
the Alethi throne is a weapon, not a seat
it is a calculus of power that demands you not retreat
I will rule because no one else can hold the contradictions
a queen who denies the church must navigate the frictions
```

### Track 6: Applied Philosophy
```
[verse 1]
the lesson is that kindness without structure is a flood
and cruelty with structure is a prison made of law
but intelligence with compassion is the sharpest thing I saw

[chorus]
philosophy is not abstract, it is the blade you choose
or win, depending on whether your axioms hold true
applied philosophy means the book hits back when you hit you

[verse 2]
Kaladin believes in protection, Dalinar believes in unity
Shallan believes in truth, and I believe in thinking clearly

[bridge]
they say I have no heart, they say the heretic is cold
but I walked into Kholinar knowing I would not be consoled

[chorus]
philosophy is not abstract, it is the blade you choose
or win, depending on whether your axioms hold true
applied philosophy means the book hits back when you hit you
```

### Track 7: What Gavilar Knew
```
[verse 1]
my uncle held a sphere of Voidlight on the night he died
he was bargaining with the Parshendi, with the listeners
he wanted to restart the Desolations

[chorus]
what Gavilar knew could have saved us or destroyed us
he was not a villain, he was not a saint
he was a man with too much power and not enough restraint

[verse 2]
Nale visited him, and Kalak, the mad and the precise
and Gavilar collected their knowledge like a miser collects vice

[bridge]
intelligence without wisdom is the most dangerous weapon
a man who sees the cosmere but not his own reflection
is a man who will burn the world and call it resurrection

[chorus]
what Gavilar knew could have saved us or destroyed us
he was not a villain, he was not a saint
he was a man with too much power and not enough restraint
```

### Track 8: The Theorem Holds
```
[verse 1]
I began as a scholar in a library in Kharbranth
and the theorem that I started with has held, has held alone

[chorus]
the theorem holds, the mind is the greatest weapon
knowledge is not power, knowledge is the light
that shows you where the power is and how to make it right

[verse 2]
Dalinar fights with honor, Kaladin fights with grief
but I fight with the certainty that the universe makes sense

[bridge]
I am Jasnah Kholin, queen and heretic and scholar
the queen who reads is the one they should not overlook

[chorus]
the theorem holds, the mind is the greatest weapon
knowledge is not power, knowledge is the light
that shows you where the power is and how to make it right

[outro]
the library does not burn
the theorem does not break
the heretic does not recant
she simply turns the page
```

**Performer:** Adolin Kholin  
**Genre:** energetic arena rock  
**Voice:** A young man in his mid-twenties with a bright, confident voice full of warmth and energy. Charming and sincere. Think a beloved prince who fights with joy rather than duty, who cracks jokes in Shardplate, but who is discovering that being good might matter more than being great.

### Track 1: Shardbearer
```
[verse 1]
Shardplate locks around me and the crowd is on its feet
I am Adolin Kholin, son of the Blackthorn, heir to the war
stance one, Windstance, the opening position learned at eight

[chorus]
Shardbearer, Shardbearer, golden boy of the Kholin line
Shardbearer, Shardbearer, the arena is mine
Blade in hand, Plate on back, crowd screaming for the hit
I was made for the spotlight and I will not quit

[verse 2]
the real fight is not the duel, the real fight is the four
Shardbearers who ambushed me in the championship's core
and Kaladin, the bridgeman, jumped in with a spear

[bridge]
I love the duel, I love the dance of Plate and Blade
the best fighter is the one who knows when not to play

[chorus]
Shardbearer, Shardbearer, golden boy of the Kholin line
Shardbearer, Shardbearer, the arena is mine
Blade in hand, Plate on back, crowd screaming for the hit
I was made for the spotlight and I will not quit
```

### Track 2: Sadeas in the Corridor
```
[verse 1]
Sadeas stood in the corridor with that smile, that knowing smile
the man who left my father's army on the Tower to die
I did not plan it, I did not calculate, I did not think
and my hand found his throat and my Blade found the need

[chorus]
I killed Sadeas in the corridor and I do not regret
the blood on the marble, the look in his eyes, the debt
he owed to every bridgeman, every Kholin soldier dead
I killed Sadeas and the golden boy saw red

[verse 2]
they would call it murder, father would call it wrong
but the battlefield was everywhere, Sadeas made it so
and the corridor was just another plateau

[bridge]
I am not Kaladin, I do not carry guilt like a shrine
I killed a man who deserved it and I would kill him twice
and the golden boy learned that day that goodness has a price

[chorus]
I killed Sadeas in the corridor and I do not regret
the blood on the marble, the look in his eyes, the debt
he owed to every bridgeman, every Kholin soldier dead
I killed Sadeas and the golden boy saw red
```

### Track 3: Maya
```
[verse 1]
my Shardblade screams when I summon her, ten heartbeats of pain
but I started talking to her anyway, the way you talk to rain
hello, I said, I am Adolin, and I do not know your name

[chorus]
Maya, I am talking to you, can you hear
Maya, I am holding you, I am right here
they say the deadeyes are gone, they say the bond is done
but I feel you pushing back against the nothing, reaching for the sun

[verse 2]
in Shadesmar she walked behind me, stumbling, eyes like glass
the honorspren said humans broke the oaths, the Recreance was our sin
but Maya chose to come with me despite what happened then

[bridge]
I am not a Radiant, I do not speak the Words
but I can talk to a dead woman and treat her like she is alive
and sometimes that is all it takes for something to survive

[chorus]
Maya, I am talking to you, can you hear
Maya, I am holding you, I am right here
they say the deadeyes are gone, they say the bond is done
but I feel you pushing back against the nothing, reaching for the sun
```

### Track 4: Lasting Integrity
```
[verse 1]
the honorspren put humanity on trial in their fortress of glass
I stood as defendant, Adolin Kholin, not a Radiant, not a sage
just a man with a dead sword and a willingness to engage

[chorus]
but Maya spoke, Maya spoke in the court of the dead
Maya pushed through the deadeye silence and this is what she said
we chose, we chose, the spren were not the victims of the oath
we chose to die with our Radiants, we chose to honor both

[verse 2]
the courtroom gasped, a deadeye had not spoken in millennia
and she said we chose, three times she forced the words through the haze
and Maya's testimony shattered every accusation

[bridge]
a dead spren saying we chose is the brightest kind of flame

[chorus]
but Maya spoke, Maya spoke in the court of the dead
Maya pushed through the deadeye silence and this is what she said
we chose, we chose, the spren were not the victims of the oath
we chose to die with our Radiants, we chose to honor both
```

### Track 5: Not My Father
```
[verse 1]
my father is the Blackthorn, the most feared warrior alive
I am not a Radiant, I do not hear the Words
I am just good with a sword and I look good in the light

[chorus]
I am not my father, I am not the storm
I am not the legend, I am not the form
I am Adolin, the one who talks to swords
and loves too easily and fights with joy, not lords

[verse 2]
father writes books and builds coalitions and speaks with gods
Kaladin flies and Shallan shapeshifts
and I am the guy who showed up with good hair and a training frame

[bridge]
maybe the world needs the man who talks to his sword and means it
who loves his family openly and is not ashamed to be in it

[chorus]
I am not my father, I am not the storm
I am not the legend, I am not the form
I am Adolin, the one who talks to swords
and loves too easily and fights with joy, not lords
```

### Track 6: Fashion and War
```
[verse 1]
yes I care about my jacket, yes I coordinate the seams
Kaladin thinks it is vain, Shallan thinks it is a mask

[chorus]
fashion and war, they are not so different
fashion and war, both require commitment
the right cut for the right occasion, the right stance for the right fight
and looking good while doing good is not a lesser light

[verse 2]
Shallan with her three faces and her artist's hand
she is the one who sees through the jacket and still wants to stand
and this is love, the argument about the collar, not the fate

[bridge]
someone should write a song about the small things in between
the jacket, the joke, the held hand, the scene

[chorus]
fashion and war, they are not so different
fashion and war, both require commitment
the right cut for the right occasion, the right stance for the right fight
and looking good while doing good is not a lesser light
```

### Track 7: Renarin
```
[verse 1]
my brother sees the future in stained glass behind his eyes
Renarin shakes when it happens, his body locks and bends
and I hold him through it every time

[chorus]
Renarin, little brother, I have got you, I am here
Renarin, the bravest Kholin is the one who lives with fear
you see what is coming and you stand there anyway
that is more courage than a duel on any day

[verse 2]
he picked up a Shardblade knowing it would scream in his hand
he charged into battle shaking, barely able to stand

[bridge]
my brother is the strongest person I know, period, end of call

[chorus]
Renarin, little brother, I have got you, I am here
Renarin, the bravest Kholin is the one who lives with fear
you see what is coming and you stand there anyway
that is more courage than a duel on any day
```

### Track 8: The Golden Son
```
[verse 1]
I am not the chosen one, I do not have a spren who glows
I am the golden son of Alethkar and I am going to try
Maya stirs in my grip, more alive each day

[chorus]
I am the golden son and I am not ashamed
of being ordinary in a world of gods and flame
I swing my Blade with joy, I wear my Plate with pride
and I stand beside the Radiants with nothing left to hide

[verse 2]
and I am here, in the middle, holding them together
not with oaths or cosmic bonds but with leather
and jokes and fashion tips and the willingness to show
that you do not need a destiny to be worth the glow

[bridge]
Maya reaches through the veil, her fingers finding mine
the proof that you can heal the dead if you refuse to let them die

[chorus]
I am the golden son and I am not ashamed
of being ordinary in a world of gods and flame
I swing my Blade with joy, I wear my Plate with pride
and I stand beside the Radiants with nothing left to hide

[outro]
the arena is empty now, the crowd has gone home
but the golden son is still here
practicing his stances
talking to his sword
and smiling
```
