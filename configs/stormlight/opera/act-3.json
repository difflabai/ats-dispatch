The one who hides in art?\nThe one who fights? The one who plays the part?\nPattern buzzes, \"Mmm, a lie, a lie,\"\nThree versions of a girl who'd rather die\nThan face the truth of what she did at ten,\nThe blade, the mother, never speak again.\n\n[chorus]\nThree girls, three masks, three ways to run,\nFrom the one true Shallan underneath the sun,\nShe fractures like a gemstone, cracked and bright,\nEach piece pretending that she's doing right.\n\n[bridge]\nThe honor theme, but played in three-part round,\nEach version slightly off, a fractured sound,\nThey harmonize, they clash, they cannot stay,\nIn tune, and something's got to give someday.\n\n[verse 3]\nVeil says, \"Forget.\" Radiant says, \"Stand firm.\"\nAnd Shallan, little Shallan, starts to squirm,\nShe draws another face, another name,\nAnother mask to play another's game.\n\n[outro]\nThree girls, one body, one terrified heart,\nComing together, falling apart."
