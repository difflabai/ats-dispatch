## Motif Occurrence Summary

| Motif | First Appearance | Climax | Total |
|-------|-----------------|--------|-------|

## Three Motif Arcs

**The Stormwall** begins as nature's terrifying force (T1), becomes a test
of endurance (T5, T14), inverts in Shadesmar (T15, T21), charges forward
triumphantly (T26), and finally resolves into a fanfare of victory (T41, T48).

**Honor's Theme** is barely audible at first (T4), gains strength through
oaths (T25), fractures with Shallan's identity (T17), is weaponized by
Jasnah (T47), and reaches full transcendence when Dalinar opens the
perpendicularity (T41). The Echo between Kaladin T8's bridge and Dalinar
T8's chorus creates the opera's defining musical link.

**The Thrill** dominates early violence (T1, T8, T23), becomes mechanical
under Szeth (T22), tempts heroes (T12, T16), reaches maximum power at
Thaylen Field (T40), then dissolves as Dalinar speaks "I am Unity" (T41).
In T42, it plays backward — violence unmade — as Szeth receives Nightblood.
