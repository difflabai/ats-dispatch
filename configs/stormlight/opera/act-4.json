Speak them true!\"\nAnd everything I am, and everything I've been,\nPours into four words that burn beneath my skin.\n\n[chorus]\nI will protect those who cannot protect themselves,\nThe Second Ideal, ringing clear as bells,\nHonor's Theme erupts, a hymn of war and grace,\nAnd Stormlight floods through every broken place.\n\n[bridge]\nThe stormwall rises, but it's mine to ride,\nNo longer beaten, no longer terrified,\nThe wind obeys, the sky is mine to claim,\nAnd Bridge Four follows, calling out my name.\n\n[verse 3]\nRock and Teft and Sigzil, Skar and Drehy too,\nLopen laughing, \"Gancho, look what you can do!\"\nWe are the bridgemen, we are the unwanted dead,\nAnd now we fly on storms of blue and red.\n\n[outro]\nI will protect, these words are accepted,\nThe Windrunner rises, broken and perfected."
