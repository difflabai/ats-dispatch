Whispered passages of haiku-like brevity explode into industrial screams. Voice carries the weight of a man forced to kill against every moral fiber. Shakuhachi breath control in vocal delivery.",

      "prompt": "industrial Japanese traditional fusion, opening: solo shakuhachi flute in empty space, then massive Nine Inch Nails distorted bass and mechanical drums crash in, taiko drums layered with industrial kick patterns, 100 BPM relentless, verse: haiku-paced vocal delivery over minimal industrial texture and shamisen, chorus: full NIN wall of noise with taiko thunder, male vocals shifting between Noh theater control and industrial screaming",
      "lyrics": "[intro - shakuhachi solo]\n\n[verse 1 - haiku pacing, each line separated by silence]\nWhite stone on my chest,\nTruthless, they declared me so,\nI obey and kill,\n\nThe stone says I must,\nWhoever holds it commands,\nMy blade their justice,\n\n[chorus - industrial explosion]\nTruthless! Truthless! I am the weapon they wield!\nTruthless! Truthless! I am the blood on the field!\nShin meadows burning in my memory,\nWhile my hands perform their ceremony!\n\n[verse 2 - haiku pacing]\nBarefoot on the stone,\nShin believe the ground is holy,\nI have walked on graves,\n\nEach king that I killed,\nWas a prayer I couldn't speak,\nForgiveness denied,\n\n[chorus]\nTruthless! Truthless! I am the weapon they wield!\nTruthless! Truthless! I am the blood on the field!\nShakuhachi screaming through the industrial waste,\nEvery death a note in sequence placed!\n\n[bridge - taiko drums only, building]\nI did not choose this,\nI did not choose this,\nThe stone chose for me,\nThe stone chose for me,\n\n[outro - shakuhachi returns over fading distortion]\nTruthless in a world of lies,\nThe most honest man alive"

      "lyrics": "[verse 1 - whispered, precise]\nWhite clothes for mourning,\nI wear the funeral of every king,\nLashing upward, gravity reversed,\nThe ceiling is my killing floor,\nWalking on walls, walking on air,\nEvery surface is a prayer,\n\n[chorus - screamed over industrial]\nAssassin! In white! The sky breaks when I fight!\nAssassin! In white! Gravity bends to my might!\nHonorblade singing, Stormlight burning,\nA weapon weeping while the world is turning!\n\n[verse 2 - controlled]\nGavilar fell on a quiet night,\nI wept as I took his life,\nHe whispered words I didn't understand,\nThe Black Sphere heavy in my hand,\nEvery lashing costs a piece of soul,\nEvery target leaves me less whole,\n\n[chorus]\nAssassin! In white! The sky breaks when I fight!\nAssassin! In white! Gravity bends to my might!\nTaiko thunder, industrial rain,\nA holy man drowning in profane!\n\n[bridge - shakuhachi and distortion duet]\nForgive me, forgive me,\nI am the blade, not the hand,\nForgive me, forgive me,\nI am truthless in this land,\n\n[outro - silence, then single taiko hit]\nThe white clothes are not for stealth,\nThey are for the mourning of myself"

      "lyrics": "[verse 1 - ceremonial]\nThe Stone Shamans guard the truth,\nSeven Honorblades hidden in the roof\nOf a temple built on meadow grass,\nWhere no man walks with shoes of brass,\n\nSacred ground, they told me so,\nSacred lies, I've come to know,\nThey made me Truthless for the crime\nOf speaking truth before its time,\n\n[chorus - processed chant]\nStone Shamans, keepers of the lie,\nStone Shamans, taught me how to die,\nThe ceremony breaks the man,\nThe ritual executes the plan,\nShamans! Shamans! Stone and steel!\nShamans! Shamans! Kneel and kneel!\n\n[verse 2 - building intensity]\nShin are peaceful, Shin are kind,\nShin are masters of the blind\nObedience that chains a soul\nTo a white stone's absolute control,\nBut I saw the Voidbringers return,\nI spoke the truth and watched it burn,\nMy reward: a life of blood,\nMy punishment: an endless flood,\n\n[chorus]\nStone Shamans, keepers of the lie,\nStone Shamans, taught me how to die,\nThe ceremony breaks the man,\nThe ritual executes the plan,\nShamans! Shamans! Stone and steel!\nShamans! Shamans! Kneel and kneel!\n\n[bridge - koto solo into industrial breakdown]\nThe stone is a lie,\nThe stone is a lie,\nThe stone is a lie,\n\n[outro]\nAnd when the truth comes crashing down,\nThe shamans scatter, the temple drowns"
