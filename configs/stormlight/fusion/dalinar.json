  "voice_instruct": "Older man, 50s, commanding bass-baritone with weathered gravitas. Maynard James Keenan's controlled intensity meets a Southern gospel preacher's fire. Capable of complex melodic phrases that shift into powerful call-and-response congregational singing. Voice carries the weight of terrible sins and the desperate hunger for redemption. Authoritative yet humble, a warlord turned prophet.",
