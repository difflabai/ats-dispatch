  "voice_instruct": "Young man, late 20s, deep baritone with raw emotional intensity. Kendrick Lamar's introspective flow meets Jeff Buckley's aching vulnerability. Capable of rapid-fire spoken word verses that shift into soaring, yearning vocal hooks. Carries the weight of depression and survivor's guilt but channels it into defiant hope. Bridge Four crew energy in group vocal sections.",
