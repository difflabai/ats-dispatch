Voice radiates golden-boy energy but carries surprising emotional depth. Capable of soaring pop-rock belting that drops into tight funk vocal grooves. Warm, genuine, occasionally devastating.",

      "lyrics": "[verse 1]\nShardplate gleaming in the afternoon,\nTen duels deep and I'm coming for the boon,\nEvery stance a dance, every strike a beat,\nWindstance, Smokestance, move your feet,\nThey call me prince but I prefer the ring,\nWhere reputation isn't everything,\nJust skill and steel and how you move,\nShardplate strut, get in the groove,\n\n[chorus]\nDuelist, duelist, come and face me,\nDuelist, duelist, can't erase me,\nOn the dance floor of the arena,\nI'm the prince, you've never seen a\nBlade that cuts and feet that slide,\nShardplate disco, step inside,\nDuelist! Let's go!\n\n[verse 2]\nRenar? Took his plate in round three,\nSadeas' champions? They can't stop me,\nFather says the duels are frivolous,\nBut Father doesn't feel the stimulus\nOf ten thousand people on their feet,\nThe roar that turns the battle to a beat,\nI fight for Bridge Four's honor and my name,\nBut honestly? I love the game,\n\n[chorus]\nDuelist, duelist, come and face me,\nDuelist, duelist, can't erase me,\nOn the dance floor of the arena,\nI'm the prince, you've never seen a\nBlade that cuts and feet that slide,\nShardplate disco, step inside,\nDuelist! Let's go!\n\n[bridge - funk breakdown]\nStance one, two, three, four,\nBlade meets plate on the dance floor,\nStance five, six, seven, eight,\nShardbearer's disco, don't be late,\n\n[outro]\nBow to the crowd, salute the fallen,\nAdolin Kholin, and I'm still balling"

      "lyrics": "[verse 1 - normal groove]\nSadeas smiled at me in the corridor,\nThat smile that sent my father's men to war,\nThe man who used Bridge Four as human shields,\nWho'd burn the world to own the fields,\nHe talked of politics, of future plans,\nThe coalition crumbling in his hands,\nAnd something in me simply broke,\n\n[the groove stops dead]\n\n[verse 2 - sparse, minor key]\nI stabbed him through the eye,\nI didn't plan to, I won't lie,\nThe golden boy with blood on golden hands,\nStanding over a body no one understands,\nShallan found me there, she didn't flinch,\nHid the body, inch by inch,\nMy secret and her secret, bound in red,\nThe prince who danced now dances with the dead,\n\n[chorus - haunted groove]\nSadeas falls and the music stops,\nSadeas falls and the dancing stops,\nThe disco ball still spins but no one's there,\nJust a golden boy with blood in his hair,\nDid I do right? Did I do wrong?\nThe silence stretches, the silence is long,\n\n[verse 3]\nFather would be horrified, I know,\nKaladin would understand, though,\nThe math that Jasnah does with words,\nI did with a knife, absurd,\nBut Sadeas would have killed them all,\nEvery bridgeman, every thrall,\nSo the golden boy made a choice in the dark,\nAnd the music carries a different mark,\n\n[chorus]\nSadeas falls and the music stops,\nSadeas falls and the dancing stops,\nBut slowly, slowly, the beat comes back,\nA different rhythm on a darker track,\n\n[outro - beat returns, changed]\nI am not sorry,\nI am not sorry,\nBut I am changed"
