Every word measured, every phrase deliberate. Capable of baroque ornamentation in vocal runs that resolve into trip-hop cool. Voice drips with intelligence and barely concealed danger. Unhurried, devastating.",

      "lyrics": "[verse 1]\nLet me present my theorem, gentlemen,\nDeconstructing your theology again,\nThe Almighty is dead, that's proposition one,\nYour faith is architecture without foundation,\nI've read your texts in their original tongue,\nCross-referenced every sermon ever sung,\nAnd the evidence, I'm sorry to report,\nMakes your entire religion fall short,\n\n[chorus]\nHeresy is just the truth\nArriving early to the room,\nHeresy is just the proof\nThat comfortable men consume too soon,\nCall me heretic, call me profane,\nI call it scholarship, call it my domain,\n\n[verse 2]\nThe Vorin church constructed careful walls\nOf ignorance disguised as protocol,\nWomen read, men fight, a tidy split\nThat keeps the powerful exactly where they sit,\nBut power, gentlemen, is not a throne,\nIt's information, and I hold my own,\nBaroque precision in my argument,\nTrip-hop menace in my instrument,\n\n[chorus]\nHeresy is just the truth\nArriving early to the room,\nHeresy is just the proof\nThat comfortable men consume too soon,\nCall me heretic, call me queen,\nI am both, I am the space between,\n\n[bridge - harpsichord solo over trip-hop beat]\nEvidence, evidence, evidence,\nReason against the reverence,\nEvidence, evidence, evidence,\nTruth doesn't care about your preference,\n\n[outro]\nI am Jasnah Kholin,\nAnd I have never been wrong about this"

Was it justice?\nThe philosophers can discuss this,\nI weighed the lives, I did the calculation,\nFour predators removed from the equation,\nCall it cold, call it cruel,\nI call it applied philosophy's tool,\n\n[verse 2]\nRenarin asked me if I feel remorse,\nI feel the weight of every course\nOf action taken, action not,\nThe trolley problem, except I'm not\nA student in a lecture hall debate,\nI am the woman at the lever of fate,\nAnd I will pull it every single time\nIf the numbers say the pull saves lives,\n\n[chorus]\nWas it murder?
