  "voice_instruct": "A young man in his early twenties with a cracked, intense tenor. Raw emotion barely held in check. The voice of someone who has been broken by slavery and grief but refuses to stay down. Spoken word with military cadence that fractures into vulnerability. Think a young soldier who has seen too much death and carries every lost life as personal failure. Darkeyed intensity, windswept and desperate.",
